			As a designer, you’re likely to have lots of fonts on your computer, but visitors to the sites you design probably
			won’t have half as many. The fonts installed on a computer depend on both the operating system and any
			other programs that have been installed. If you choose an unusual font for your page, in all likelihood, few of
			your visitors will ever see the page the way you envisaged. Consequently, you should always choose several
			alternatives similar in design and proportions to your preferred choice.
